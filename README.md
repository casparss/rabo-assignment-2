# Rabo assesssment Caspar Sambrook-Smith

Hello there :) Here's my assessment submission.

I enjoyed putting my Angular hat back on again.

## I spent one evening on this, had I had more time, I would've:
- Added proper aria tags in
- Tidied up the styling, perhaps added some animations
- Written some tests
- Perhaps improved the filter functionality some more
- Done some proper browser testing
- Used Storybook to build components

## What I've done:

- I've tried to make components as reusable as possible, for example the file drop is built first as a directive and then consumed by the file drop component
- Tried to make code readable and straight forward
- I've used Material UI components for th UI
- The filters can only be one at a time, so usnused filters will blur. There are three filter patterns on the built-in so you can select either: `<=`, `>=`, and `match`. Should be self-explanitory, but can be used to fulfill the spec asked for
